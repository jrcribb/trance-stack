<h1>Mixpanel</h1>

We use Mixpanel to track user behavior and events.
This allows us to better understand how our users interact with our products and how we can improve them.

<h2>Usage</h2>

The mixpanel component depends on the `window.appConfig` object to have a few properties set:

- `mixpanelToken` - The token for the mixpanel project
- `isProduction` - Whether the app is running in production mode or not (typically `NODE_ENV === 'production'`)
- `mixpanelApi` - The API endpoint for mixpanel
- `visitorId` - The ID of the current visitor

<h3>Example</h3>

~~~jsx
import { Mixpanel } from '~/components/Mixpanel';

<Mixpanel />

~~~
